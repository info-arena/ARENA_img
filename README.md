This GitHub repo hosts the diagrams and images used for the [ARENA](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0) materials.

### File names
Going forward, please name new diagrams in the following format: `ch#-diagram-name` (e.g. `ch3-safety-cases`). If a chapter is large and has many sections, name diagrams `ch#-sec#-diagram-name`.

When you edit/update a diagram, make sure to upload it with the **same name**. Otherwise, you will need to update the URL address in the corresponding ARENA Streamlit and Colabs.
